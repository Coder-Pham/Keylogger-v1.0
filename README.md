# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This **Keylogger v1.0 is 1 of 9 Social Engineering Toolkit** that I'm working on. In this project, I only build the core of the Keylogger, so that there is no embeded-file function as well as decryption function for the log file. 

However, you can try my **Keylogger with Python** which I have posted for `OFFENSIVE SECURITY (KALI LINUX)`. But I still recommend you to use this version because of its processing speed. 

But do not worry, this **Keylogger** will have the Send Mail function which send you both the encrypted log file and the content of decrypted log file (but it's quiet hard to read, you will need a lot of patience).

In every `header & main.cpp`, I have commended quiet a few, so you can understand it easily. But in case you don't understand what part of it, please feel free to contact me through:

If you have any suggestion for this **Keylogger**, please just raise your idea. If possible, I will try to make that.

**NOTE THAT: I will upload embeded-file function & decryption function so keep following me to update the Keylogger**
**PLEASE ONLY USE THIS FOR EDUCATION, ETHICAL HACKING & PENETRATION TESTING. I WON'T RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ILLEGAL HACKING**
